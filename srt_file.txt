[Music]
hello everyone in today's video we're
going to be building youtube video
downloader using python okay so
this is the app
we can select the path to save our video
i'm going to select in this case i'm
going to i'm going to use the music
folder and then select folder and then
it's going to uh put the path to display
the path here where you want to save
your video
okay so the next step is to go to
youtube and look for a link or a video
that you want to download
so in this case i'm just going to go to
my youtube channel
and then i'm gonna look for a video to
download
let's say this this is the video that i
want to download
i'm gonna go to share and then copy the
link
then i'm gonna come back to the app
so
just paste in the
the the link here ctrl v to paste
and then select download
and then the title is going to change to
downloading
okay
so it's downloading the file
so that's why it's not responding for it
for
for a bit so just wait a bit and then
it's gonna download the file
okay so now it says download complete
download another file as you can see now
the video is in my folder so i can
now play the video
okay so this is the video
okay so i've muted this sound by the way
that's where you can hear the sound i've
muted the sound so
the video works fine and everything
works fine
yeah that's what we're going to be
building in this video so if you want to
see more python videos in the future
just let me know in the comments and
then yeah i'll see in the video
okay so before we get started make sure
you have python downloaded so in this
case i'm using python 3.9
uh also go to the extensions and
download
an extension called python
if you don't have it already
python make sure the spelling is correct
python
okay so this is the extension that you
need
okay so make sure you download that
okay so now let's just create a new
python file new file so let's just call
it download
dot py
okay so we're also going to be using uh
some external modules so we're going to
install those later but for now let's
just start by building the ui of the
website
okay so
we're going to import our ticker enter
so we're going to do from
tk
tk enter and then we're just going to
like import everything
so to import everything you need to use
the star
and then i'm going to do from
tk into as well
make sure this panning is correct
so from ticker enter i'm going to import
something called
file dialog i'm going to explain what
we're going to use there for
file dialog
okay
import file dialog
okay
so that's it for now and then if we need
anything we're going to actually import
some external modules later on so yeah
let's get started with creating the
the main ui
uh we're going to be using an image as
well so that's the image i've included
here it's like a youtube logo
we're just going to be using that
okay so to get started we're going to
we're going to do screen
and then we're going to say
this goes to tk
so this ticker is coming from the ticker
interlibrary
okay
so we're going to
start with the title the title of the
the app
so we're going to do screen
dot
title
okay so for the title you can name this
whatever you want so i'm just going to
say youtube
download
download okay so you should download so
that's the title of the screen
okay so
for us to see something we need to uh
specify like a canvas like the the size
of the app
canvas
so how big do you want the canvas
to be so in this case
make sure it's a capture letter
this one should be a small letter c
that was automatic so this one should be
a capital letter
canvas okay like that and then we need
to specify
the screen
and then do within the height
so the width
uh in this case i'm going to start with
500 you can use a bigger weight if you
want and then the height
it's going to be 500 as well
okay so now we have the width and height
so let's run this
we do canvas to pack
so it's a function so make sure you do
it as a function
okay so
in the middle we're going to have some
code and then after that we're going to
do screen
dot main loop
okay it's a function so now let's run to
see what we have so when we run
we're going to see a window so now we
have like a window saying youtube
download
so now uh let's add the image and the
inputs
whatever
information that we need okay
so
i'm gonna start with uh image logo
i'm just gonna comment that like so we
know that it's going to be an image a
logo image
and then here we are going to do photo
photo image
and then we're going to do file
and then we're going to
specify the directory of the file the
name so
the file is in the same directory with
our python files so we don't need to
uh go to folders and stuff we just need
to
name the file so the file is yt.png
so that's the name of the
the image
but let's run this to see what we have
actually we cannot run here we need to
edit to the canvas first
okay i'm going to
add that image to the canvas so to add
the image to the canvas we just we can
do
canvas dot
create
image so that's how we are going to add
the image to the canvas
okay so i'm gonna do 250. so 250
is the
x
x axis location 250 and then on the y i
want it to be on 80. so it's like
location
okay
image
so for the image uh i'm going to use the
logo image
okay so the location for the x-axis 250
for the y is 80 so i'm gonna run this
okay as you can see our image is quite
huge so into a way to resize this image
so
below the image i'm just going to
comment resize so we want to try to
resize this image to make it smaller
okay so to resize this image we're going
to do logo
logo img so that's the logo image
and then we're going to do logo img
logomg and then dot subsample
to resize this
so the sub sample returns a new photo
image based on the
same image as this widget blah blah blah
you can read the rest so but it's a way
for us to resize this image
okay so i'm gonna say two and two
okay so now let's run to see what we got
so now the image is
much smaller than it was before
okay so that's good so now let's keep
going
so now
i'm going to
actually at i was thinking of adding a
text saying youtube downloader but i
don't think i'm going to do that
okay so now i'm just going to create
some
fields
okay i'm just gonna say
link
field okay so the link field
i'm gonna do link
field
it goes to
entry
entry which is the screen
and then the width is going to be
50.
okay so we have a link field and then we
have a label as a link
link label
so for link label i'm going to do it
it's going to be a label so the label is
going to be
on screen as well screen
and then what we're going to do a text
so for this label we're going to
say enter
link
actually download link
makes more sense
like that
download
kind of inspire download down
load
link
like that
okay so this is the label for entering
the download link so now we need to add
these uh widgets to the to the to the
window
so i'm gonna comment
um
i'm gonna say add
widgets
to window
okay so now we're adding the windows
widgets to the window i'm going to do
canvas and then i'm going to do create
window to edit
create window
window okay so like that and then i need
to specify the coordinates as well so
i'm gonna do 250
for the x
okay so 250 and then for the y i'm going
to do 170
and then i'm going to do window
so the window is going to
do link
label
and then i'm going to duplicate this so
the second one is going to be
220 for the y
and then it's going to be link field
what
field
okay like that
so now we've added that let's run this
to see what we got
so okay so now we're going to enter the
download link
okay but
the font size it doesn't it's very small
we can actually
increase that we can do font
and then we can
type the name of the font that we want
and then we can separate that and then
put the size so i want it to be 15.
okay so let's run to see what we have
i want to close this
okay there there we go so the font is
much bigger now
okay
so now we've we've done the the buttons
not the buttons the
input field so now we actually need to
do the buttons
okay so i'm going to say
uh download
i'm gonna try to collapse this
a little bit
okay so i'm gonna say
download
btns so it's like the download button
okay so i'm going to say download
btn
okay so this is going to be the download
button it's actually going to be
the last widget
so download button
we're going to do screen
uh we're going to do a text we're going
to give it a text so the text is going
to be
download
file
so that's going to be the the name of
the
the button download file
okay
so we've done file
actually
uh before the button
i might need to add the path
uh the path for the
user to save the file to
okay so i'm just gonna go uh above here
i'm just gonna say
comment i'm gonna say select
path
for
saving
the file
okay so this is like
a button which you have to click and
then it it's going to link you to the
path
so i'm going to say path label
and then this is going to be a label
another label
so this label is going to
have screen
as all text
so the text for this one we're just
going to say select select path
select path
path
or download
i can't even spell this word
download okay so now select path for
download and then i'm just going to copy
this font
uh
okay i'm gonna put it like that
okay and then
below that i'm gonna have a button to
select
the path
okay i'm gonna say select
select
btn
and then i'm gonna say equal to is gonna
be a button so it's going to be a
different widget
and then we're going to do text
so the text this one is going to be
select
okay so we have the text
okay so now we just need to add
at the at these buttons okay
so let's do that
so i'm gonna do
add
to
[Music]
window
okay i'm gonna do
a canvas
canvas dot
oh so we want to create a window
create window
so for this one we're going to do 250
for the x axis and then for the y it's
going to be 280
okay so you can experiment with this uh
position
okay you can
experiment around and then this one is
going to be the path label
so the second one is going to be
3 30
30
and then the is going to be the select
select button
okay
so finally we just need to add something
to the canvas
which is this download button
so add
add to canvas
okay so now to add this to the canvas
we're just going to do the same thing uh
canvas dot
create window
and then we're just going to add that
the coordinates for the x axis push mic
are going to stay the same for this
video 390 and then we're going to do
window
window
so for the window we're just going to
do the download button that's what we
want to add okay so now that's pretty
much everything for the
uh widgets that we were going to be
using i'm just going to run this
okay so now that's
everything that's we need that we need i
mean so now when i click this button
i want to select the path and then once
that path is selected i want to change
this label to the path whatever path the
user have selected
okay so
let's work on that functionality
so to
work on that functionality i'm going to
define a new function
okay so let's go up here i'm just gonna
say put a comment i'm just gonna say
functions
okay
so um i'm just gonna create a function
i'm gonna name this select
select
path
path okay so that's the name of the
function
okay
so now we're doing a select path
function so in in this function we're
not going to have many function many
functionality so i'm just going to
comment here
i'm going to do path
path it's a variable called path and
then we're going to do file
file dialog
software dot ask directory
so the the file dialog uh it allows the
user to select a path from the file
explorer so this is a functionality that
allows anyone to
select any directory into your computer
okay it allows the user to do that
okay so i'm just going to comment this
allows
user to select
a path
path from the explorer
flora
i don't know explorer
whatever that mean
okay so now
so now we just need to
do uh you know do you remember the path
label
x
this one this path
path label this one so we want to want
to click the select button so if we
select a path we just want to put
whatever path here to this label
okay
so
we're just going to do path label
label
what do i name the path label
it should be somewhere
path label there it is
so path
label
okay so we're just going to change
to configure that to change
the text to
so to the path okay whatever path the
user enters
so now this this function we're not
using this function yet
so we need a way to use that uh
the function
so let's go to the button uh the select
button this one so to call this function
we need to use something called a
command
okay so that's the function so this one
is going to be
path
label i think that's what i've named the
function actually select path
so that's the name of the command select
path
okay so now i'm going to save this and
run this to see
what if it's going to let me select the
path you know i'm going to put this on
another screen so i don't want you to
see my private information
okay yeah it lets us select the path
when we click the button
okay
everything is working as expected
all right so
now we just need to work on the
functionality
to download the video so to do that
we're going to download a few external
modules okay
so it's just two modules actually so the
first one we're just going to do pip
install
so the first one is going to be movie
py
okay
okay so i've already uh installed that
before so
i've used obviously before so install
that and then the second one is pip
install
pi
tube like this and then hit enter
i've done that before so it's not going
to let me do that so
so it's uh
movie pie and then a pie tube that's
those are the ones that we need in this
video
i'm gonna clear this
okay
so now uh we just need to import those
up here
so i'm gonna do
uh import
like not import actually i'm gonna do
from
uh movie pie
i'm gonna do
import i'm gonna just import everything
so inputting everything you have to use
the star okay
and also i'm going to do from
movie pie
i'm going i'm going to
do dot editor
and then i'm going to import something
called video file clip
okay like that
and also we need to import the pie tube
from
pi
tube
and then we're just going
to import
youtube
okay because we're building a youtube
downloader
so i'm just going to define a function
here so this one is going to be
download file download
file
okay
download file
we're getting an error because well
there's nothing in this function i'm
just going to do pass so we don't get
that error
okay
so in this function
so that's where the main functionality
is going to be
okay so we need to a way to get the user
path
okay
so to get the user path i'm just going
to comment this
get user path whatever a user path they
chose i'm going to say get
link
and then i'm going to say equal to
link field if you remember the
the link field
label link field
dot
get
okay so we're running the get function
okay so and
when you need to get the selected path
whatever the path the user selected
okay so get
selected
path okay so whatever the user whatever
path the user selected i'm just going to
say user
path
and then i'm gonna set that to the
path label
and then i'm gonna say
dot c
get
okay so we want to get the text
text okay so we're getting the text
okay so now i'm gonna say
download
video
okay so
download video so this one after that
that's like we're going to create the
functionality for downloading the actual
video
so we need this video to be to download
the video we need to do youtube
youtube
so it's coming from one of the modules
uh here up here
okay
so we need to youtube
and then
we do get link
get link and then we're going to do dot
streams
streams
okay and then we're going to do the get
again so we need to get the highest
resolution of whatever video we're
downloading so we need to get the
highest resolution as possible
okay and then we're going to run the
download function
okay so i'm going to save this in a
variable
const
so this is going to be like an mp4
video
okay mp4 video
so
i'm using javascript
mp4 video
okay so
the next one
is going to be
another video
file clip
it's coming from the module here movie
pie
okay so we're going to use that mp4
video
okay we're going to also put this into a
variable
uh i'm going to name this video
a vid clip or something i don't know
whatever you deserve to name it so i'm
going to name this video video clip
okay so we're going to close afterwards
so v clip
dot close so we're going to run the
function to close that
okay so now
i'm going to save this
okay
uh oops
i'm going to
i'm going to look for developer
edition developer
it's just the browser that i use
okay i use the developer edition
okay so i'm gonna go to youtube
youtube and look for a video
whatever video um actually i'm gonna go
to my channel
so it's better that way i need to use my
own videos not other people oh sorry
about that
i need to find the shortest video as
possible
so yeah i used to make like
really
trashy videos back in the day so i'm
just need i just need to find like a
short video
that makes sense or this one i'm just
gonna
uh
actually i need to mute my
my sound how do i do that
function
i can't find the button okay i've done
it so now i just need to play this and
then i'm gonna
copy the link copy that
and then go back
so now we just need to run the app
so let's ctrl v to paste in the link and
then click the download file nothing
happens because
we are not
using this download file function
okay so
let's go to the
download button we need to do the
command if you remember command
and then we'll set the uh
the download function
it's download file that's the function
and then let's run this
okay now paste in the link
and then hit download
okay nothing happens
it's just froze but look look look look
in the folder
the file is there
okay
so if it's it's if it's taking a bit of
a pose it means it's downloading
okay and then after it's finished
downloading it's gonna start working
again but
our file is here we can actually play
this we can view this in
explorer review explorer
what did i do
okay so we can oops
review and explore and then we can
actually play this file
okay so we can play the video so there
it is we can play the video
now we just need to
move this file to whatever directory the
user select they have selected i mean
so whatever directory you've selected we
want to move that file
so to do that well we're going to import
something called shuttle that is coming
from the
it's not coming from and it's coming
from the python module called shutter
okay so i'm going to import that import
shutter we don't need to it's not
external it's already built in so it's
we're going to import that shadow so
this is a module that allows us to
copy files and folders and move them to
whatever location that we want to
okay so now we just need to
move
um
the file to the selected directory so to
do that
uh we just i'm just going to comment
move
to selected directory
okay i'll comment that and then here i'm
just gonna do
shutter
make sure you do the
correct spelling
okay so
i'm gonna do it's a function dot move
function
okay so we're going to move the mp4
video
okay so we're going to move that to the
user path
whatever the user path selected we're
going to move that
actually you know what
for us to know the video is downloading
oh it's finished it's finished
downloading i'm just going to
change the title of the screen i'm going
to say screen
title
and then i'm going to change that to see
if the download is complete or is this
downloading i'm just going to say
download
complete
okay and then i'm gonna say
select
or
download
uh
download
another file
okay so download complete download
another file
okay
uh you can
another
file
okay so we're also going to copy this
so we want to change this as well when
we're downloading the actual file
okay so here
when it starts downloading i'm just
gonna
change the title to downloading
downloading
thing like this
okay so when it's downloading it's gonna
change after it's complete it's gonna
change
okay
so now let's uh
let's go ahead and run the app
again so i'm gonna
run this
okay so i'm gonna select a path
okay nothing crazy
select a path
let's say i'm gonna save mine into
downloads downloads folder
or actually desktop i'm going to select
desktop
okay so i've selected the desktop
i just need to paste in this
actually i need to go back again and
copy the link
i'll copy the link
i'll paste in this link download file
now it changed to downloading
okay
so it's downloading the file
seems to be not working
because it says the file exists
somewhere it says it exists in the
desktop oh okay i've downloaded the file
already before
i just need to change the directory i'll
change this directory
okay so i'll select another directory
okay i'm just gonna put it into a random
folder i'm gonna put in the music
okay i'm just gonna download file so now
it's downloading
now it says download complete download
another file okay so you can download as
many files as you want so now i'm just
going to
see if that file exists in the music
okay so now if i go to the music the
video is there
okay so i can play this video
all right
okay yeah i mean that's it for this
video
uh you can request uh if you want to see
more pattern videos in the future
i'll see you again in the next video
